# HoloLens surface co-located keyboard
Contains the full interface used in The Impact of Surface Co-location and Eye-tracking on Mixed Reality Typing paper during Experiment 1.

This application takes participants through three counterbalanced conditions:
- **Midair** --- The keyboard was placed in midair in front of the participant. The keyboard was angled 15 degrees above horizontal to make it more comfortable to type on.
- **Table** --- The keyboard was placed just above a table, using a QR code on the table to ensure consistent spatial placement. The keyboard was placed horizontally, such that the back of the keyboard was parallel with the table.
- **Wall** --- The keyboard was placed slightly in front of a wall, using the same QR code as a spatial anchor. The keyboard was placed vertically, such that the back of the keyboard was parallel with the wall.

Participants were asked to copy 12 sentences in each condition.

The file QR_Code.pdf can be used to print the QR code that the application uses to spatially locate the keyboard.
